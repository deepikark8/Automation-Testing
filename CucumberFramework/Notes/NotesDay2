  - Sendkeys - user enter into text box "logicalName" "value"
  - ButtonClick - user click on Button "logicalName" 
  -	RadioButoon - user click on radioBtton "logicalName"
  	
  	Pages - We store elements & actions but Actions are move to the BasePage
  	BasePage - should be extended by each page - created the storage location - HashMap - which holds logicalName and By Object
  	Steps  - cucumber annotation of the scenario
